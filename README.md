# HTML Tailwind boilerplate
### How to use
1. Click the "Use this template" button above. It will create a repo under your profile.
2. Clone the new repo created in #1
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm run dev`

It will automatically start a server at `http://localhost:8080/` using `dist/` as the public path

### Development
The source files you will be working with are `src/js/app.js` and `src/css/app.scss`. Laravel mix will automatically compile these files to `dist/js/app.js` and `dist/css/app.css` respectively.
